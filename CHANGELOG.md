## 0.0.16-alpha

**[BR]** = Breaking Change
- Project directory restructure
- Can now include Knit as a Git submodule and reference the default rojo project to sync in (see below)
- Added unit tests for Knit-specific utility modules
- Added simple integration tests
- TableUtil fixes, additions, and improvements:
   - **[BR]** All functions (except `FastRemove` and `FastRemoveFirstValue`) no longer mutate table
   - Fix `Filter` bug introduced in v0.0.15-alpha
   - Fix behavior of `Extend` to extend arrays and not dictionaries (use `Assign` to extend a dictionary)
   - Add optional RNG override parameter for `Shuffle`
   - Add `Flat`, `FlatMap`, `Keys`, `Find`, `Every`, and `Some` functions
   - Add documentation page for TableUtil
- Simplify `Knit.OnStart()` internally to use `Promise.FromEvent`
- Update Rojo version used by CI/CD pipeline
- Fix broken links in documentation pages

## 0.0.15-alpha

- Memory leak fixed with Streamable when instance was immediately available
- `Knit.GetService(serviceName)` added to server-side Knit
- Minor improvements to TableUtil
- Util documentation split across multiple pages

## 0.0.14-alpha

- Fix Signal leak when firing with no connections
- Change `._instance` to `.Instance` in Component
- Components will use attributes to store unique ID instead of StringValue
- Add `Signal.Proxy` constructor to wrap built-in RBXScriptSignals
- Add `Maid:GivePromise` method
- Allow dictionary tables in `StreamableUtil.Compound` observers list

**Note breaking changes from above:**
- When upgrading, make sure to change `._instance` field accessors to `.Instance` for components
- `ServerID` StringValue for components has been switched to use attributes: `instance:GetAttribute("ComponentServerId")`

## 0.0.13-alpha

- `Component:WaitFor` has been rewritten to utilize built-in promise features better, which also eliminated an existing event connection leak.
- `Streamable` and `StreamableUtil` modules added to easily manage parts that may stream in & out during runtime when using [`StreamingEnabled`](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/StreamingEnabled).
- Documentation improvements.

## 0.0.12-alpha

- Added new 'Add' functions to automatically load all modules in a folder. This is useful for quickly loading a bunch of service or controller modules:
   - `KnitServer.AddServices(folder: Instance)`
   - `KnitServer.AddServicesDeep(folder: Instance)`
   - `KnitClient.AddControllers(folder: Instance)`
   - `KnitClient.AddControllersDeep(folder: Instance)`
- Split up remotes to server/client versions:
   - `RemoteEvent` -> `RemoteSignal` and `ClientRemoteSignal`
   - `RemoteProperty` -> `RemoteProperty` and `ClientRemoteProperty`
- Knit module isn't required to live in ReplicatedStorage now
- Added `EnumList` class which wraps `Symbol`s to create pseudo-enums
- Added style guide in documentation

## 0.0.11-alpha

- Documentation fixes and additions
- Better table support for `RemoteProperty` class
- Fixes and additions to `Option` class
- Optional behavior argument for `Thread.DelayRepeat`
   - **Note:** If using var-args list for `DelayRepeat`, this is a breaking change. `DelayRepeat`'s third argument must be the behavior (`Thread.DelayRepeatBehavior.Delayed` or `Thread.DelayRepeatBehavior.Immediate`).
- Added `Symbol` class

## 0.0.10-alpha

- Switch default branch from `master` to `main`
- `Component:WaitFor` first arg can now be a name or instance
- `Init` for individual components is called after a heartbeat, which helps allow components to get other components without race conditions when `Component.Auto` is used.

## 0.0.9-alpha

- Fixed issue where remote objects were parented before services completed initialization. This created a possible race condition between services initializing and clients loading Knit.

## 0.0.8-alpha

- Added `Option` class for creating optionals.

- Upgraded `Promise` to v3.0.1.
