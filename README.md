## :warning: No Longer Maintained :warning:

Knit has been archived and will no longer receive updates. I have created DeKnit for those looking for a solution to Knit's flaws - it's not perfect and still has some issues that sleitnick has mentioned, but it implements fixes for most issues that were prevalent in Knit, that were originally worked around by the user and not the framework itself.

Please [read here](/ARCHIVAL.md) for more information on Knit's archiva;.

# DeKnit

DeKnit is a lightweight framework for Roblox that simplifies communication between core parts of your game and seamlessly bridges the gap between the server and the client. It is also a fork of sleitnick's Knit project. 

Read the [documentation](https://sleitnick.github.io/Knit/) for more info anout Knit, read this readme to see how to use DeKnit.

## Install

Installing DeKnit is very simple. Just drop the module into ReplicatedStorage. Knit can also be used within a Rojo project.

**Roblox Studio workflow:**

1. Get [DeKnit](https://www.roblox.com/library/5530714855/Knit) from the Roblox library.
1. Place DeKnit directly within ReplicatedStorage.

**Wally & Rojo workflow:**

1. Add DeKnit as a Wally dependency (e.g. `DeKnit = "isophes/deknit@^1"`)
1. Use Rojo to point the Wally packages to ReplicatedStorage.

## Basic Usage

The core usage of Knit is the same from the server and the client. The general pattern is to create a single script on the server and a single script on the client. These scripts will load Knit, create services/controllers, and then start Knit.

The most basic usage would look as such:

```lua
local DeKnit = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Packages.DeKnit)

DeKnit.Start():catch(warn)
-- DeKnit.Start() returns a Promise, so we are catching any errors and feeding it to the built-in 'warn' function
-- You could also chain 'await()' to the end to yield until the whole sequence is completed:
--    DeKnit.Start():catch(warn):await()
```

That would be the necessary code on both the server and the client. However, nothing interesting is going to happen. Let's dive into some more examples.

### A Simple Service

A service is simply a structure that _serves_ some specific purpose. For instance, a game might have a MoneyService, which manages in-game currency for players. Let's look at a simple example:

```lua
local DeKnit = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Packages.DeKnit)

-- Create the service:
local MoneyService =  {}

-- Add some methods to the service:

function MoneyService:GetMoney(player)
	-- Do some sort of data fetch
	local money = someDataStore:GetAsync("money")
	return money
end

function MoneyService:GiveMoney(player, amount)
	-- Do some sort of data fetch
	local money = self:GetMoney(player)
	money += amount
	someDataStore:SetAsync("money", money)
end

DeKnit.Start():catch(warn)
```

Now we have a little MoneyService that can get and give money to a player. However, only the server can use this at the moment. What if we want clients to fetch how much money they have? To do this, we have to create some client-side code to consume our service. We _could_ create a controller, but it's not necessary for this example.

First, we need to expose a method to the client. We can do this by writing methods on the service's Client table:

```lua
-- Money service on the server
...
function MoneyService.Client:GetMoney(player)
	-- We already wrote this method, so we can just call the other one.
	-- 'self.Server' will reference back to the root MoneyService.
	return self.Server:GetMoney(player)
end
...
```

We can write client-side code to fetch money from the service:

```lua
-- Client-side code
local DeKnit = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Packages.DeKnit)
DeKnit.Start():catch(warn):await()

local MoneyService = DeKnit:GetService("MoneyService")

MoneyService:GetMoney():andThen(function(money)
	print(money)
end)
```

Under the hood, DeKnit is creating a RemoteFunction bound to the service's GetMoney method. DeKnit keeps RemoteFunctions and RemoteEvents out of the way so that developers can focus on writing code and not building networking infrastructure.
